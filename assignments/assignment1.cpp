cout << "My last name is: Montes " << endl << endl;
cout << "My email address is: jmontes989@student.msjc.edu" << endl << endl;
cout << "This assignment is due on the 19th of August 2018" <<endl << endl; //the endl here is techinally not needed since this is the last line we are outputting to the screen
